### Home Automation System ðŸš€

A Java-based simulation of a smart home automation system demonstrating device control, energy management, temperature regulation, and system monitoring.

#### Features:
- **Device Control**: Toggle device states (light, fan, AC, heater) using bitwise operations.
- **Energy Management**: Calculate and display total power consumption with arithmetic operators.
- **Temperature Regulation**: Control devices based on room temperature using relational and logical operators.
- **Modes of Operation**: Dynamically switch between normal and energy-saving modes using a ternary operator.
- **Scheduling**: Automate device actions based on time intervals with modulus checks.
- **Safety Checks**: Automatically turn off devices if total power exceeds safety thresholds.

#### Use Case:
This program is a foundational template for home automation projects, showcasing Java programming concepts like bitwise manipulation, control flow, and conditional logic.
